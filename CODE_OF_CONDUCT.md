# Code of Conduct

## Our Purpose

The Epstein Pipeline exists to make public interest documents accessible and searchable. It is a tool for accountability journalism, academic research, and civic transparency. Every contributor shares the responsibility of handling this material with care and integrity.

## Standards

### Expected Behavior

- **Be factual.** All data, claims, and documentation must be grounded in verifiable source material. Cite DOJ EFTA numbers, court filing IDs, or other primary sources.
- **Be respectful.** Treat all contributors with professionalism. Disagreements about methodology are welcome; personal attacks are not.
- **Be careful with names.** The person registry contains real people, including victims and witnesses. Handle all names with the understanding that misattribution causes real harm.
- **Protect privacy.** Do not attempt to identify unnamed victims. Do not publish contact information for private individuals. Do not cross-reference data to deanonymize protected persons.
- **Focus on the documents.** This project processes government releases. It is not a platform for speculation, conspiracy theories, or content that cannot be tied to specific source documents.

### Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, threats, or intimidation of any kind
- Doxxing or publishing private information about any individual
- Attempting to identify unnamed victims or minors referenced in documents
- Publishing recovered redacted content without review for victim protection
- Using the pipeline or its output to harass, stalk, or target individuals
- Submitting deliberately false or misleading data
- Spam, self-promotion, or off-topic content in issues and discussions

## Enforcement

Violations of this code of conduct may result in:

1. **Warning** — A private message explaining the violation
2. **Temporary ban** — Restricted from contributing for a set period
3. **Permanent ban** — Removed from the project

Decisions are made by project maintainers and are final.
